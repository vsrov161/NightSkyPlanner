# NightSkyPlanner
Smart notes tool for astronomers and astrophotographers

Night Sky Planner is a work-in-progress tool designed to help plan astronomical observations and photo sessions. It allows tracking the time when a specific star or celestial object appears in the observer’s field of view.

### Future plans include possible integration with the SynScan Pro app. The project is still in an early stage, and both the idea and this README are evolving over time.

### The Goal
My goal is to finish this app using most of the features that UIKit provides.
For practicing I'm going to use NSLayoutConstrains as well as SnapKit, and URLSession as well as Alamofire.

### Techs that's going to be used in app
- as I said - most of UIKit pieces
- Alamofire
- URLSession
- URLComponents
- SnapKit
- CoreData

#### Planned features and ideas
- Home Screen with current weather, sun clock and current Moon Phase
- Notes Screen with ability to add new note of object of interest, observation date and time, and set reminder
- Map screen with fav places, which user already visited for night sky observations, or planning to do so
- Settings Screen with notifications, night mode, and some "about this..." stuff
- Integration with SynScan pro(Sky-Watcher GOTO systems)
- Not sure if it's necessary, I might add meteor shower calendar
