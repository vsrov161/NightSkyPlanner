# NightSkyPlanner
Smart notes tool for astronomers and astrophotographers

Night Sky Planner is a work-in-progress tool designed to help plan astronomical observations and photo sessions. It allows tracking the time when a specific star or celestial object appears in the observer’s field of view.

### Future plans include possible integration with the SynScan Pro app. The project is still in an early stage, and both the idea and this README are evolving over time.

#### Planned features and ideas
- Home Screen with current weather, sun clock and current Moon Phase
- Notes Screen with ability to add new note of object of interest, observation date and time, and set reminder
- Settings Screen
